<h1>Legecy of Bikini Atoll</h1>

<h2>
    intro
</h2>
March 1, 1954
The US has set up shop in the Marshell Islands testing out hydrogen bomb, specify on Bikini Atoll. During this time there was a boating ship from Japan called Lucky Dragon 5. The ship was unaware of the testing and was affected by the bomb due to the fall out, and only once person died the radio operated. The rest of the crew was able to recover, however Japan was very unhappy with America they protested any nuclear weapons. This then would inspire the creation Godzilla. During that time, he was used to talking about nuclear weapons. But over his 70 years of being created they have used him in many ways, going from commentary on politics and the state of the world, to a childish hero and, even just a monster that fights others for no reason. During his time, he spawned 5 different eras.

Godzilla minus one? (2023)

<h1>
    Showa era of movies
</h1>

This era started with the idea of horror but as the movie was going on the tone was slowly shifting, making Godzilla into a hero and more child friendly as many funny things came out of this period of Godzilla. 
Godzilla would then take a nine-year break coming back for its 30th anniversary. Starting the second era of Godzilla 

<h1>
    The hesies era 
</h1>

For this era they tried to make a reboot to the movies making the first movie is the only one that had happen in the story line of the film. However, in this he would stay as an antihero and the movies had more focused on the themes of environmental devastation and scientific advancement, along with that they even gave a background story the Godzilla making him into a dinosaur that was still alive and was nucked turning into the monster people know him as he is now.  
Then Godzilla would stop again for another four years before making a comeback to the screen.

<h1>
    The millennium era 
</h1>
 
It would again reboot the whole franchise this time only keeping a few stories to be its new cannon and would build on top of them and they would even ignore each other’s films in this time making It seem like they are different stories. This era would close with a movie being made to celebrate 50 years of Godzilla and would have toho give the rights to ledged to make another film. 
This would then complicate things as they now have several Godzilla properties running wild as toho would also give the right to Netflix to make anime/ animated movies. This would split to two eras of timelines of the movie the monsterveres of legendry and reiwa era 

<h1>
    The legendry movie 
</h1>

throws out everything Godzilla and they completely cleaned slate of the Ip of Godzilla as they redo his story as they were intruding their version of Godzilla to America. Keeping Godzilla as antihero and his origin changed to him being an ancient monster. These films would now feel more action packed and block buster as they would get bigger budgets to make the films. 
During this happens in America in Japan another film was being made shin. Released years after the American Godzilla, this time around everything was different as it seems like a return the roots of the Godzilla or at the idea. As this film was inspired by another disaster that Japan faced 2011. As it was showing how Japanese official would have to go into meeting back-to-back to get anything done. After these films the other Netflix anime would join this era making it more to the original film making Godzilla into an unstoppable force. 

My thoughts on this are interesting that we have a contrast between the different Godzilla now showing both sides of what he is doing both as hero and villain. 

<h1>
    Top 5 in my opinion
</h1>

1 shin Godzilla
This movie was released in 2016 and was a different take on Godzilla as they had him evolving throughout the film. This felt like a return to form where Godzilla was again viewed as allegory for a disaster that happened in Japan. 
2 godzilla minus one
Just last year this movie was released to the public and it did a great job as it was the retelling of the original movie and changing a few things in the film. It would take the same topics of the first one as it was a commentary on how nuclear weapons are dangerous. While change the human side so it would also talk about how the government of Japan was clause in pass times and that it should be better.
3 final wars
This was a movie that was pure dumb fun, it was also the movie that was made for Godzilla’s 50 birthday.  As it would take some pieces from pass movies and put it in. as they would have Godzilla kill most of his monsters he had face up to this point. The movie was a mixed bag as some liked it and others did not splitting the fandom slightly.
4 godzilla vs destoroyah 
This one was used to end an era as this was made to be the movie where Godzilla dies Toho wanted this movie to be important as this would end the movie giving Godzilla a rest of ten years as they handed the movie right to Hollywood. To kill Godzilla in this movie they end up using what killed him the first time make a monster out of the bomb that killed in his first outing. Another element that I liked from this movie was how they made Godzilla into a melting down nuclear reactor. 
5 Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster 
This was the first appearance of Ghidorah, the most noted enemy that Godzilla would face as he became a fan favorite coming back for every era of Godzilla. And every time they brought him to the screen you can feel that he is a real threat to Godzilla.

<h1>
    Fun facts 
</h1>

For king Kong vs Godzilla, the original plan was to make it Godzilla vs frankestine but couldn’t get the rights for that. 

Situation was used up to Final wars then after that Godzilla would go completely CGI

Shin Godzilla wasn’t going to made by toho as they didn’t like the idea of an evolving Godzilla but was forced into as bandi had gotten information on the changing Godzilla and stared making figurines. 

For Shin Godzilla they used motion capture and the images where so funny having a man commit to the bit wearing a Godzilla mask and spins and short tail.

America had their hands on making a Godzilla cartoon where he is a hero with his son godzuki

Godzilla 3D was a movie that was going to be made in 2005 but was scrapped and would then inspire the legendary movie of Godzilla in 2014 and would have Godzilla defending the “9/11 monument.”

Godzilla is cannon in dragon ball manga. 

There were short films of Godzilla vs Bambi. 

1985 Godzilla had a funeral. 

1998 Godzilla movie made in America it was so bad that Japan had to take out Godzilla for his break to keep the fandom alive.

Each office in Japan Toho studio is named after a monster from the Godzilla world.

In a English dubbing of the movie they have godzilla talking to another monster

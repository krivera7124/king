                         March 1, 1954
                        The US has set up shop in the Marshell Islands testing out hydrogen bomb, specify on Bikini Atoll. During this time there was a boating ship from Japan called Lucky Dragon 5. The ship was unaware of the testing and was affected by the bomb due to the fall out, and only once person died the radio operated. The rest of the crew was able to recover, however Japan was very unhappy with America they protested any nuclear weapons. This then would inspire the creation Godzilla. During that time, he was used to talking about nuclear weapons. But over his 70 years of being created they have used him in many ways, going from commentary on politics and the state of the world, to a childish hero and, even just a monster that fights others for no reason. During his time, he spawned 5 different eras.

                        <p>Before the making of the first movie The Director Ishirō Honda was making a film in Indonesia, however, he was unable to make the film as Indonesia wasn’t letting in a few of the Japanese actors. So Honda had to go back home and his flight back to Japan he would look over the sea and wonder what would happen if a monster came out of the sea. He would then make the first film as Godzilla started as a horror icon and a incarnation of the atomic bombs. The first film did great, leading to more movies to be made but the as the series would go on the tone that the first film would have would slowly disappear. Within the first few years Godzilla would still stay as a reminder of the atomic bombs but he was slowly changing as the movies would then have Godzilla turn into a antihero. Gearing the brand into a more child friendly so they could get more audience to look at Godzilla. After his nine years of making films Toho would then put Godzilla on a nine-year break as they planned to bring him  back for its 30th anniversary, starting the second era of Godzilla.

                        <h2>Origin 1954 </H2>
                        <p>Godzilla exists as a metaphor of the pain and destruction caused by the atomic bombs that were dropped on Nagaski and Hiroshima during World War II. In the Japanese 1954 film, Godzilla, it was explained that the monster was a prehistoric reptile of some sort who was mutated by radiation from a nuclear test conducted by the United States military in the Pacific Ocean. The large amount of radiation absorbed by the reptile caused it to grow to gigantic proportions. Named "Godzilla," the creature attacked Japan but was ultimately killed by a device called the Oxygen Destroyer. The sequel, Godzilla Raids Again, revealed that two of these reptilian creatures were actually impacted by the atom bomb test. The first was killed in 1954, but the second survived. This version of Godzilla returned in the Toho films that followed.

              <P>
                For this era they tried to make a reboot to the movies making the first movie is the only one that had happen in the story line of the film. However, in this he would stay as an antihero and the movies had more focused on the themes of environmental devastation and scientific advancement, along with that they even gave a background story the Godzilla making him into a dinosaur that was still alive and was hit with a nuclear bomb turning into the monster people know him as he is now.  
Then Godzilla would stop again for another four years before making a comeback to the screen.

              <h2> Origin 2 (1991) </h2>
              <p>Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, the third installment in the Heisei series of Godzilla films, expanded on his classic origin story by diving deeper than ever into the incident that created him. It was revealed that on an island in 1944, a group of Japanese soldiers encountered a dinosaur who rescued them from the U.S. military. It was believed that the creature - who was given the name "Godzillasaurus" - was the same reptile that was transformed by the atom bomb test into Godzilla.
                A team of aliens used time travel to go back to 1944 and erase Godzilla from existence. They moved the Godzillasaurus to a different location, that way he wouldn't be affected by the radiation. The aliens swapped Godzilla with three small creatures who were mutated into King Ghidorah. Later, the Japanese decided that Godzilla's existence was necessary to beat Ghidorah, so they decided to find the Godzillasaurus and hit him with enough radiation to recreate his original transformation. To make this happen, they bombarded him with radiation, unaware that in the 1970s, the Godzillasaurus found a sunken, Russian nuclear submarine and had already been mutating as a result. Getting hit with a second, even bigger dose of radiation made Godzilla more powerful than he ever was before.

              <h2>Orgin 3 (2001) </h2>
              <p>Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack stands out as a movie where Godzilla is a truly evil, supernatural entity. It also exists in a separate continuity from all other Godzilla films, but does act as a continuation of the 1954 movie. In the film, Godzilla was indeed killed by the Oxygen Destroyer in 1954, but his body wasn't destroyed. It became possessed by the souls of the people who died in the Pacific Ocean during World War II.</p>

          <p>It would again reboot the whole franchise this time only keeping a few stories to be its new cannon and would build on top of them and they would even ignore each other’s films in this time making It seem like they are different stories. This era would close with a movie being made to celebrate 50 years of Godzilla and would have toho give the rights to ledged to make another film. 
            This would then complicate things as they now have several Godzilla properties running wild as toho would also give the right to Netflix to make anime/ animated movies. This would split to two eras of timelines of the movie the monsterveres of legendry and reiwa era

          <h3>The Legendary Era</h3>
          <p>The legendry movie throws out everything Godzilla and they completely cleaned slate of the Ip of Godzilla as they redo his story as they were intruding their version of Godzilla to America. Keeping Godzilla as antihero and his origin changed to him being an ancient monster. These films would now feel more action packed and block buster as they would get bigger budgets to make the films. </p>
          <h2>Origin 4 (2014)</h2>
          <p>Legendary's Godzilla kept the connection to the nuclear incident of 1954, but altered the circumstances of the event and what it meant for Godzilla. It was mentioned in the 2014 Godzilla that the military's "test" in 1954 was actually an attempt to kill Godzilla, an ancient creature that had lived for thousands of years. Godzilla survived the nuclear bombs, however, and returned in 2014 to battle the M.U.T.O.s. The MonsterVerse completely changed the meaning of Godzilla by making him a force of nature, rather than a product of humanity's mistakes.
            In the MonsterVerse, Godzilla is one of several Titans, enormous creatures who feed off of radiation. Most of them hibernate deep within the Earth and in hidden underground tunnels called the Hollow Earth. Godzilla (the last known member of his species) exists to preserve the balance of nature by protecting the planet from threats like Ghidorah.

          <p>During this happens in America in Japan another film was being made shin. Released years after the American Godzilla, this time around everything was different as it seems like a return the roots of the Godzilla or at the idea. As this film was inspired by another disaster that Japan faced 2011. As it was showing how Japanese official would have to go into meeting back-to-back to get anything done. After these films the other Netflix anime would join this era making it more to the original film making Godzilla into an unstoppable force. 
          </p>
          <h2> Final Origin </h2>
          <P>Toho's Shin Godzilla rebooted the franchise and served as the biggest deviation from the traditional story ever produced by the studio. The monster depicted in Shin Godzilla was a villainous, grotesque beast that possessed a number of brand new abilities. Originally a prehistoric sea-dwelling animal, it was somehow exposed to nuclear waste in the ocean, leading it to mutate into a strange, eel-like creature. It went through several hideous forms before finally evolving into a monster with the distinguishing physical characteristics of Godzilla. In its first two forms, it didn't even have legs.
            This is without a doubt the most unusual portrayal of Godzilla in a Toho film - but it won't be seen again. Toho does have plans to move forward with the Godzilla franchise, but the next installment will be yet another reboot. When that happens, Toho may introduce a new take on Godzilla, complete with a new origin.
